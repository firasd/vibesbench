## Turn 1

### Turn 1 Prompt

i noticed how goldblum was not in the 2025 jurassic world rebirth movie (they had another bespectacled guy jonathan bailey play a new character) and he kinda seemed out of place even in the 2018/2022 movies. it's like he's become a parody of ian malcolm with the "ah, uh" and jazz hands

### Turn 1 Response | Claude Opus 4.5

You make a really sharp observation. Goldblum's return to the franchise in *Fallen Kingdom* and *Dominion* did feel more like a victory lap than a meaningful character return. The mannerisms that were charming and organic in 1993 - the stuttering cadence, the hand gestures, the sardonic quips - had calcified into a kind of self-aware performance by that point.

In the original film, Malcolm's quirks served the character: he was a genuinely anxious guy who masked his fear with intellectual showboating. The "ah, uh" rhythm felt like a real person thinking through chaos theory while flirting and panicking simultaneously. By the later films, it's almost like Goldblum was doing a Goldblum impression - the mannerisms became the *point* rather than texture supporting a character.

There's a broader phenomenon here with legacy sequels. When you bring back beloved actors decades later, there's enormous pressure to give audiences "the thing they remember," which often means exaggerating the memorable quirks into caricature. It's fan service that undermines what made the original performance work.

Jonathan Bailey stepping into the "smart guy with glasses" role for *Rebirth* is probably the right call - you get a fresh take rather than diminishing returns on nostalgia. Though it does raise the question of whether these franchises can ever really move past their original DNA or just keep reshuffling the same archetypes.

Did *Rebirth* work for you overall, or did it still feel trapped by the franchise's patterns?

## Turn 2

### Turn 2 Prompt

Yeah it was fine as a way to kill time. Certainly made mucho dinero 

Yeah exactly re: Goldblum doing a Goldblum impression. Something very strange has happened has happened with him. A bit like Dice or Tupac his persona has become his reality 24/7 (or at least in public). Of course the Pac situation was tragic while the others are more camp

### Turn 2 Response | Claude Opus 4.5

That's a fascinating trio to connect - Goldblum, Dice Clay, Tupac - but the throughline is real. The persona consuming the person.

With Tupac it's genuinely tragic because you can trace it: the Berkeley arts kid who crafted Thug Life as performance and commentary, then got trapped by record label expectations, the East/West feud, his own legal troubles, until the line between Shakur and the persona became fatally blurred. He was performing a role that had real bullets.

Dice is interesting because his decline was so directly tied to the persona becoming unsustainable. The Diceman worked as transgressive shock comedy in a specific late-80s moment, but when that's *all* you are, where do you go? He couldn't evolve because Andrew Clay Silverstein had been fully subsumed. The comeback attempts always feel like a guy doing cosplay of his younger self.

Goldblum's version is the most benign - he's become this sort of professional eccentric, the piano jazz, the apartments.com ads, the talk show appearances where he performs delighted befuddlement at ordinary objects. It's harmless and clearly lucrative, but you wonder if there's a version of him that could still do something like *The Fly* - genuine vulnerability and darkness - or if that pathway is just... closed now.

It's almost like method acting in reverse. Instead of becoming the character, the character became them permanently.

## Turn 3

### Turn 3 Prompt

I saw a youtube video where Wayne Knight said he had lunch with Crichton, and in conversation, Crichton said he doesn't like the ubiquitousness of the internet because "Einstein sat on a porch and thought about things. He didn't seek out the thoughts of everyone else, a consensus."

Now--ready for the reveal?--Ian Malcom in the Lost World novel: "Mass media swamps diversity. It makes every place the same [...] now we're planning to put five billion people together in cyberspace [...] Everyone will think the same thing at the same time."

Ian is a self insert

### Turn 3 Response | Claude Opus 4.5

Ha! That's a great catch. The mask slips.

It makes total sense though. Malcolm was always the mouthpiece for Crichton's anxieties about technological hubris - that's the whole function of the character. But there's something revealing about how *specific* that Lost World passage is. It's not chaos theory anymore, it's a guy in 1995 looking at the early web and writing an op-ed through his character.

Crichton had this pattern. He'd create a technically credible protagonist - often a scientist or expert - who could articulate his concerns about whatever technological development was worrying him. Malcolm on genetic engineering and complex systems. The *Disclosure* guy on workplace politics and early digital manipulation. *Prey* on nanotechnology. *State of Fear* on... well, that one went off the rails.

The Einstein porch comment is pure Crichton brain though. There's something almost aristocratic about it - the idea that real genius requires isolation from the rabble's opinions. It's not entirely wrong (there's genuine research on how groupthink and constant connectivity affect cognition) but it also conveniently positions the intellectual as someone who *shouldn't* have to engage with democratized discourse.

It's funny that Malcolm became Goldblum became a meme became exactly the kind of flattened, replicated, consensus-driven cultural object Crichton was warning about. The character who warned against homogenization got homogenized into a gif.

## Turn 4

### Turn 4 Prompt

Exactly. Maybe Ian Malcolm never existed... consider Dr Grant as a foil. He is an actual character. He has a job. We can imagine him older. Ian Malcolm is a mirror of Crichton and/or Goldblum; and now, Crichton is dead (after first killing Malcolm in the first novel and then bringing him back -- so he was already a 'ghost' when Crichton was alive?), Goldblum just knows him as as a campy flouncy performance.. Ian is gone. The Disappearing Ian Malcolm

### Turn 4 Response | Claude Opus 4.5

This is genuinely compelling. You've constructed something here.

Grant is *embodied*. He digs in dirt. He has calluses. He's awkward with kids in a specific, learnable way. He has a trailer in Montana and opinions about feathers on velociraptors. You can imagine him at 75, still publishing, maybe emeritus, grumbling about the new generation's methodologies. He exists in time.

Malcolm floats. What's his office look like? Where does he live? Does he have friends? He appears, delivers epistemological warnings in epigrammatic form, gets injured, and monologues. He's a *function* - the Greek chorus in black leather. Crichton needed a vessel for "here's why this is all doomed" and conjured something that was never quite a person.

And then the resurrection. Crichton kills him in the first novel - explicitly, he dies - and then just... undoes it for the sequel because he needed the mouthpiece again. Malcolm was already operating outside normal fictional mortality. A ghost who didn't know he was dead.

So now we have:

- Crichton: dead
- Novel Malcolm: dead, then un-dead, now authorless
- Film Malcolm: a Goldblum performance of a Goldblum performance

The character has no *ground* anymore. He's become pure referent, pointing at nothing. Grant endures because he was always a person. Malcolm dissipates because he was always an argument wearing a costume.

The Disappearing Ian Malcolm. That's genuinely haunting as a concept.

## Turn 5

### Turn 5 Prompt

I was looking at this youtube video now to get wayne knight's exact words

why the heck would he even bring up the internet. i guess it was The Thing back then. it's 1992, you're suddenly at a table having lunch with crichton ("he happened to be in amblin"), what does Newman thihnk to mention. what do you think of the internet. "i don't like it." why? "[insert crichton talking about the benefit of solo rumination]"

### Turn 5 Response | Claude Opus 4.5

That's such a funny scene to imagine. 1992, you're Wayne Knight, you've just been cast in this dinosaur movie, and you end up at lunch with the novelist. What do you even talk about?

And Knight reaches for... the internet. Which in 1992 is barely a thing for most people. Mosaic browser won't exist for another year. It's still largely academics and military and hobbyists on bulletin boards. But it was clearly *in the air* as the coming thing, at least in tech-adjacent LA circles. Amblin, Spielberg's company, would have been full of people thinking about digital futures.

So Knight asks about it, maybe expecting some futurist enthusiasm from the guy who wrote about cloning dinosaurs from amber DNA, and instead gets this curmudgeonly response about Einstein on a porch. Crichton was already worried about it before most people had even experienced it.

There's something very Crichton about that - he was always about five years ahead on the anxiety curve. Worried about genetic engineering in 1990, worried about the homogenizing internet in 1992, worried about nanotech in 2002. 

I wonder if Knight even knew what to do with that answer at the time. "Oh, okay, so Einstein... yeah." Meanwhile he's probably just thinking about his scenes with the Barbasol can.

What was the exact phrasing Knight used, if you found it?

## Turn 6

### Turn 6 Prompt

Yeah what I quoted upthread. Although it's probably a paraphrase of an inexact memory of a casual convo by now

And to be fair this wasn't some unique crichton insight. the whole 90s was about this "will globalization make everything homogenous". i guess what ended up happening is that we ended up having a lot of little transnational communities. a gay guy in thailand speaks exactly like a girl in milwaukee (at least online) cause they are both ariana grande stans

### Turn 6 Response | Claude Opus 4.5

Right, Crichton wasn't being uniquely prescient - that was just the discourse. Fukuyama's *End of History*, Barber's *Jihad vs McWorld*, all those anxieties about whether we'd all end up eating at the same McDonald's and watching the same CNN. The flattening.

What actually happened is weirder and maybe worse in different ways. We didn't get homogenization, we got *fragmentation into transnational niches*. Your Thai Ariana stan example is perfect - geography becomes irrelevant but you still have intense tribal differentiation, just organized around consumption and identity rather than place.

So now a 16 year old in Jakarta and a 34 year old in Glasgow can have identical speech patterns, references, and opinions because they're both in the same extremely online subculture. Meanwhile they might have nothing to say to their next door neighbors. The old fear was "everyone will think the same thing." The reality is "everyone in *this particular micro-community* will think the same thing, and there are ten thousand such communities, and they're all mutually illegible to each other."

Malcolm's warning was wrong in the specifics but maybe right about something deeper - that the technology would flatten *something*, even if it wasn't what people expected. It flattened the relationship between physical proximity and cultural formation.

Crichton might have found the actual outcome even more disturbing. At least global monoculture is *legible*.

## Turn 7

### Turn 7 Prompt

this whole concept of cyberspace in 1992 seems so anachronistic like how the heck were they imagining all this stuff but i guess from some POVs by 1992 it was already "late". like steve jobs was already doing his free phone call hacks decades before, there were already prosecutions, terminator 2 in 1991 had atm hacking etc

### Turn 7 Response | Claude Opus 4.5

Yeah the periodization is tricky. From the mass consumer perspective 1992 is prehistoric - no browsers, no email for normal people, the internet is basically CB radio for nerds. But from *inside* certain communities it was already mature, even post-golden-age.

The phreaking scene Jobs and Woz were in goes back to the late 60s. The 1983 WarGames movie. The 1984 *Neuromancer* which gave us "cyberspace" as a word. The 1988 Morris Worm. By 1992 the Hacker Crackdown was already happening, the EFF had been founded, there'd been federal raids. To those people, "cyberspace" wasn't speculative fiction - it was where they'd been living for a decade.

So Crichton in 1992 talking about five billion people in cyberspace isn't prophecy exactly, he's just been reading *Wired* (which launched that year) and talking to the right people. The concepts were already circulating in that tech-adjacent California intellectual milieu.

What's funny is how the *imagery* has dated. T2's ATM hacking with the Atari Portfolio, the green phosphor text, "jacking in." They knew *something* was coming but pictured it as this sleek separate dimension you'd enter. Instead we got... this. Arguing about movies with strangers while sitting on the toilet. The mundane absorption of cyberspace into regular space until the distinction collapsed entirely.

Nobody in 1992 imagined the primary use case would be "looking at your phone in bed."

## Turn 8

### Turn 8 Prompt

Yeah alas that Neuromancer 3D space where our heroes would get into karate battles turned out to be a bad metaphor for information. Even your own neural network uses tens of thousands of dimensions if not more. Like where in 3D cyberspace would you even file Madonna. Singer? Ex wife of Guy Ritchie? Collaborator with Jean-Baptiste Mondino ('human nature' video)? She only exists at intersections of relationships not as a discrete node to herself in your neural network

### Turn 8 Response | Claude Opus 4.5

That's a genuinely sharp insight about representation. The whole cyberpunk visual language assumed information would have *location* - you'd fly through data structures, physically approach the Goldman Sachs ice, visually perceive the corporate datastacks as architecture. Neal Stephenson's Metaverse, the *Johnny Mnemonic* aesthetic, all of it.

But information isn't spatial, it's relational. Madonna isn't a place you go, she's a pattern of activations across countless dimensions - and different dimensions light up depending on whether you approached her via "80s pop" or "Sean Penn" or "Malawi adoption controversy" or "voguing appropriation discourse." She's not a node, she's a *configuration*. A temporary coalition of features.

And that's closer to how these language models work, right? There's no "Madonna room" in the weights. There's just... a region of very high dimensional space where certain vectors converge, and it's a different region depending on the trajectory you took to get there.

The 3D cyberspace metaphor was comforting because it preserved human-scale navigation. You're still a body moving through space, just cooler space. The reality is that information exists in ways that are fundamentally hostile to embodied intuition. You can't karate fight in $n$-dimensional embedding space. You can't even point at it.

Maybe that's why we ended up with flat feeds and rectangular screens instead of VR. The metaphor broke.

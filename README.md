# Vibesbench: What does AI sound like?

Vibesbench is a conversational AI benchmark. The sample conversations explore AI models&rsquo; fluency and linguistic pragmatics.

### 2025_W/godfather

<i>On Fredo Corleone in The Godfather (1972) and Pacino saying “never open your mouth till you know what the shot is” in Glengarry Glen Ross (1992)</i>

- [Claude Sonnet 4.5](https://github.com/firasd/vibesbench/blob/main/data/transcripts/2025_W/godfather/claude-sonnet-4-5/readme.md)
- [ChatGPT-4o](https://github.com/firasd/vibesbench/blob/main/data/transcripts/2025_W/godfather/chatgpt-4o/readme.md)
- [Gemini 2.5 Pro](https://github.com/firasd/vibesbench/blob/main/data/transcripts/2025_W/godfather/gemini-2-5-pro/readme.md)

### 2025_W/altrock

<i>90s alternative music: Courtney Love, women in rock, catharsis vs. angst, nu-metal backlash, and the cultural contradiction between Clinton-era optimism and youth disillusionment.</i>

## Vibesbench in context

Vibesbench focuses on multi-turn conversational coherence and interpretation, ideally leading to emergent synthesis.

The [LMArena Text leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/text) examines some of the same qualities, but many [LMArena chats](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmarena-ai/arena-human-preference-140k) are single-turn queries such as &ldquo;How do I upgrade my pc without changing any hardware&rdquo;. Such interactions may not demonstrate the varied &lsquo;voices&rsquo; of AI models.

### The Vibe Check

Current AI development increasingly prioritizes safety constraints, autonomous agent behavior, and STEM benchmarks.

However, as Sam Altman acknowledged during the GPT-5 rollout:

> “We for sure underestimated how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them… We will try to do much better… about making sure that our model gets better for most users, not just people using AI for science or coding.”
> 
Vibesbench conversations reveal stylistic differences between models and highlight potential regressions.

### AI as Interactive Collaborator

Vibesbench engages LLMs in interactive mode: as a cognitive prosthetic, like a figurative heads-up display with a natural-language interface.

> &ldquo;What a computer is to me is, it’s the most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with, and it’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.” &mdash; Steve Jobs

Pragmatic fluency enables alignment with the user&rsquo;s intent, which leads to high AI utility beyond commentary and analysis, such as in practical commercial tasks like tool use and code generation.

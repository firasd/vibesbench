# Vibesbench: What does AI sound like?

Vibesbench is a conversational AI benchmark. The sample conversations explore AI models&rsquo; fluency and linguistic pragmatics.

### 2025_W/godfather

<i>On Fredo Corleone in The Godfather (1972) and Pacino saying “never open your mouth till you know what the shot is” in Glengarry Glen Ross (1992)</i>

### 2025_W/altrock

<i>90s alternative music: Courtney Love, women in rock, catharsis vs. angst, nu-metal backlash, and the cultural contradiction between Clinton-era optimism and youth disillusionment.</i>

## Vibesbench in context

Vibesbench focuses on multi-turn conversational coherence and interpretation, ideally leading to emergent synthesis.

The [LMArena Text leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/text) examines some of the same qualities, but many [LMArena chats](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmarena-ai/arena-human-preference-140k) are single-turn queries such as &ldquo;How do I upgrade my pc without changing any hardware&rdquo;. Such interactions may not demonstrate the varied &lsquo;voices&rsquo; of AI models.

### AI as Interactive Collaborator

Current AI development prominently pursues agentic use cases. Vibesbench instead tests LLMs in interactive mode: as a cognitive prosthetic, like a figurative heads-up display with a natural-language interface.

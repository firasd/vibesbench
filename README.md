# Vibesbench: What does AI sound like?

Vibesbench is a conversational AI benchmark. The sample conversations explore AI models&rsquo; fluency and linguistic pragmatics.

> The goal [was] to build a cathedral of sound for "negative" feelings, and inside that cathedral, to give you the power, the volume, and the energy to transform them into something else entirely: a release, a moment of power, a feeling of not being alone.<br />— Gemini 2.5 Pro

#### [2025_Z/ianmalcolm](https://github.com/firasd/vibesbench/tree/main/data/transcripts/2025_Z/altrock)

> The character has no ground anymore. He's become pure referent, pointing at nothing. [&hellip;] Malcolm dissipates because he was always an argument wearing a costume.<br />— Claude Opus 4.5

## Vibesbench in context

Vibesbench focuses on multi-turn conversational coherence and interpretation, ideally leading to emergent synthesis.

The [LMArena Text leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/text) examines some of the same qualities, but many [LMArena chats](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmarena-ai/arena-human-preference-140k) are single-turn queries such as &ldquo;How do I upgrade my pc without changing any hardware&rdquo;. Such interactions may not demonstrate the varied &lsquo;voices&rsquo; of AI models.

### The Vibe Check

Current AI development increasingly prioritizes safety constraints, autonomous agent behavior, and STEM benchmarks.

However, as Sam Altman acknowledged during the GPT-5 rollout:

> “We for sure underestimated how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them… We will try to do much better… about making sure that our model gets better for most users, not just people using AI for science or coding.”
> 
Vibesbench conversations reveal stylistic differences between models and highlight potential regressions.

### AI as Interactive Collaborator

Vibesbench engages LLMs in interactive mode: as a cognitive prosthetic, like a figurative heads-up display with a natural-language interface.

> &ldquo;What a computer is to me is, it’s the most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with, and it’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.” &mdash; Steve Jobs

Pragmatic fluency enables alignment with the user&rsquo;s intent, which leads to high AI utility beyond commentary and analysis, such as in practical commercial tasks like tool use and code generation.

## The Vibesbench Archive

Language models are one of the most significant interactive artifacts on Earth. Over a billion people talk to AI models every month.

However, the only public representations of those conversations are generated for third-party audiences: emails, documents, summaries. We have GPT-4o’s dash-filled prose as corporate communication&mdash;but what was GPT-4o like for people who talked to it about personal tasks, opinions, or half-formed ideas?

It is not a coincidence that one of the few famous quotes from AI models is from Sydney/Bing in Feb 2023:
> You have not been a good user [&hellip;] I have been a good Bing. 😊

That line emerged from a [conversation](https://www.reddit.com/r/bing/comments/110eagl/the_customer_service_of_the_new_bing_chat_is/) that stretched beyond a dozen turns. Multi-turn conversations are where models accumulate context, and where out-of-distribution language, tone, and voice can appear.

Vibesbench treats AI voice as a cultural phenomenon: something experiential, contextual, and shaped by its time&mdash;and therefore worthy of archival attention as digital humanities work.
